# Collaboration and e-sports

* We are always open to collaborating with other guild and neutral pro players. Wildfire are on the quest to push competitive gameplay across all 3 existing game modes of Illuvium. (ILZ/Overworld/Auto-Battler)&#x20;
* We have regular gameplay streaming on our Voice channel, where you can jump on to play with other guild members/visitors, or just watch to learn the basics if you are new to certain gameplay styles.
* Once a month/quarter/week/etc. we host a tournament, the winner receiving \*insert prize\*.&#x20;
* In the future, we will also be building out our very own e-sports team...watch this space.&#x20;
